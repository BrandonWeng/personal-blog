We've all been there—stuck on a problem, tempted to ping a colleague for help. While someone might unblock you instantly, developing the habit of finding answers yourself is invaluable. Here's how I've learned to systematically approach finding solutions, leveraging the tools at our disposal. It's not just about solving the current problem; it's about building your problem-solving skills for the future.

### Step 1: Apply Systematic Debugging
Before reaching out to others, I always try to debug the issue systematically:

1. **Reproduce the problem**: Create a minimal example that demonstrates the issue.
2. **Check logs and error messages**: Often, the solution is hidden in plain sight.
3. **Use debugging tools**: Leverage breakpoints and step-through debugging in your IDE.
4. **Isolate the problem**: Try to narrow down the issue to a specific component or function.

### Step 2: Leverage LLMs and Search Tools

I spend at least 20 minutes using AI tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity. These Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide quick, accurate responses to coding problems.

When using LLM assistants, I:

1. **Provide context**: Give few-shot examples to help the AI understand the problem.
2. **Be specific**: Craft clear, concise queries for better results.

If LLMs aren't helping, Google can still be a great tool to find answers or discussions about the problem.

### Step 3: Explore Internal Resources

If the question is business-specific, internal resources are goldmines.

1.  **Slack/Teams**: I search through our company’s Slack or Teams channels. Chances are, someone else has encountered and solved a similar problem.
2.  **GitHub/Confluence/Notion**: I check our organization’s repositories and wikis. There might be relevant discussions or documentation in the README files or wiki pages.

### Step 4: Investigate External Resources

For package or software-related issues, external communities and documentation can be extremely helpful.

1. **GitHub Issues**: I look through the open and closed issues in the repository of the package/software I'm dealing with. Often, other users have faced similar problems, and I might find a solution or a workaround.
2. **Slack/Discord**: Many open-source projects have dedicated Slack or Discord channels where maintainers and community members discuss issues and features.
3. **Search Engines**: Search engines like Google or Perplexity are invaluable tools for finding answers or discussions about the problem. They can quickly point you to relevant resources, documentation, forums, or blog posts that address your specific issue.

### It's Okay to Seek Help

While self-reliance is crucial, it's equally important to recognize when it's time to ask for help. After exhausting the steps above, if you're still stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to colleagues or mentors.

Remember, seeking help isn't a sign of weakness—it's a sign of maturity and good judgment. The key is to approach others with a clear explanation of the problem, what you've tried so far, and specific questions about where you're stuck.
