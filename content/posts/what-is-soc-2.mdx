As a startup founder, you're likely focused on building your product, acquiring customers, and growing your team. But if you're handling customer data, you need to be aware of SOC 2 compliance.

### What is SOC 2?
SOC 2 is a voluntary compliance standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) that focuses on how organizations manage and protect customer data.

### Why Should Startups Care About SOC 2?
If you're storing customer data, you'll likely undergo vendor reviews that assess your security posture. This may include:
- Security questionnaires
- Compliance and penetration testing reports

Prioritizing SOC 2 compliance early offers several advantages:
1. **Competitive edge**: Many startups overlook compliance initially, so you can stand out.
2. **Easier implementation**: It's a multi-month process that becomes more challenging the longer you wait.
3. **Scalability**: Building compliant systems from the start is easier than retrofitting later.

You don't want to be stuck in a situation where the customer likes your product but their security team blocks your product because you're not SOC 2 compliant.

### What's the difference between SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2?
As a startup handling customer data, understanding the difference between SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 audits is crucial. Let's break it down in simple terms:

**SOC 2 Type 1**
   - Point-in-time assessment of control design
   - Shorter duration (1-2 months)
   - Auditors may often just test your policies.

**SOC 2 Type 2**
   - Evaluates control effectiveness over time (3-12 months)
   - Tests how well your controls actually work in practice over time by asking you for populations and testing a subset of them
   - Required by many enterprise customers.

Startups typically progress from Type 1 to Type 2 as they mature their security practices or based on customer demand.

### Getting Started with SOC 2 Compliance

1. **Choose a compliance automation platform**: Consider options like Vanta or Drata to streamline the process.
2. **Implement key controls and policies**: Focus on essential security practices.
3. **Set up vendor integrations**: Ensure your tools and services are compliant.

This <a href="https://www.latacora.com/blog/2020/03/12/the-soc-starting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> is also a good overview of what is required to get started from an implementation standpoint. It might be outdated, but the general process is the same. I will work on an updated version of this soon, but until then, you can use this as a good starting point.

### Key considerations:

- Engage an auditor early, even before reaching 100% framework completion. (This is very common)
- Expect ~2 weeks for fieldwork and ~1 month for final report delivery.
- It will probably take your company 1-2 months to prepare for a Type 1, depending on your background.
- Choose your auditor carefully, considering reputation, lead times, and pricing.
- If using a compliance platform, ask for auditor recommendations familiar with their system.
- Start with SOC 2 in mind if you're a B2B SaaS company to ensure timely reporting.
