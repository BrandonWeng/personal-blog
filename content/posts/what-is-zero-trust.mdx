"Zero Trust" has become a buzzword in cybersecurity, and for good reason. Here's an attempt to explain what it is and why it's important.

## What is Zero Trust?
Zero Trust boils down to "never trust, always verify." It treats every user, device, and network as potentially hostile. Imagine a world of spies: trust no one, verify everything.

The core idea is that no one and nothing should be automatically trusted, the objective is to operate under the premise that every office space is akin to a public coffee shop.

In practice:
1. Every request is treated as if it's from an untrusted network.
2. Verify identity and device health every time.
3. Grant only the least privilege necessary.


## Why Now?

Traditionally, most companies followed a "castle and moat" approach: build strong perimeter defenses, and trust everything inside. Once you're past the drawbridge, you're in.

However, remote work, cloud services, and evolving threats have rendered this approach obsolete. One breach could be catastrophic, especially for startups handling sensitive data.

## The Road Ahead

Implementing Zero Trust isn't just about protectionâ€”it's about building customer trust. In today's landscape, robust security is a competitive edge.

Remember, Zero Trust is a journey, not a destination. Start small with your most critical assets and expand from there. By building security into your DNA from day one, you avoid costly retrofitting later.
