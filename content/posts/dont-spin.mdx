"Spinning" is a term one of my old managers at Databricks used to describe engineers, especially new graduates and interns, who spend excessive time on a problem without making progress. It's a common pitfall that can hinder both individual and team productivity.

### Recognizing When You're Spinning
Identifying when you're stuck in a loop is crucial. Here are some signs:

- You've been working on the same issue for more than a day without progress
- You're revisiting the same resources repeatedly without new insights
- You feel frustrated and your productivity has significantly dropped

### Strategies to Avoid Spinning

- **Exhaust available resources**: Refer to the [previous blog](/posts/1-searching-for-the-right-answer) on efficient resource utilization.
- **Use the rubber duck method**: Explain your problem to an inanimate object (or a willing colleague). Often, articulating the issue can lead to breakthroughs.
- **Take a break**: If you're stuck, step away for a while. This will help you refocus on the problem and get back on track. It may seem counterintuitive, but sometimes your brain just needs a rest.
- **Start over**: Don't get too wrapped up in the problem. Take a deep breath and step back. This will help you assess the situation and make a fresh start. For example, consider nuking your PR and starting over from scratch now that you have a better understanding.
- **Learn from each experience**: Keep track of what worked and what didn't. This helps you improve at deciding when to dig in and when to seek help. Adjust and find the balance between getting things done and self-learning.

### When and how to Ask for Help

- **Assess urgency honestly**: Prioritize seeking help for issues blocking others or critical deadlines.
- **Prepare your question**: Before asking, summarize the problem, your attempts, and specific areas where you're stuck. Include relevant code snippets, error messages, and any information needed to reproduce the issue.

While all questions have value, it's crucial to avoid labeling every issue as urgent. Overusing urgency can desensitize your team, potentially hindering timely assistance when truly needed. The right balance varies for individuals and organizations. Finding this equilibrium is more art than science, and mistakes are part of the learning process. The key is to remain mindful and continuously learn from each experience.
